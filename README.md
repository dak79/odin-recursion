# Recursion

## Description

This project is part of The Odin Project - Full Stack JavaScript Path.
The main goal is to understand recursion and sorting algorithm for enhancing
the abilities of code optimization. In the project we analyze time complexity
and space complexity of algorithm.

## Technologies

JavaScript, npm, git.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1 - Fibonacci

- Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an
  array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.
  Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array
  [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
- Now write another method fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.
  This can be done in just a couple of lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t
  consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).

### Assignment 2 - Merge Sort

- Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array,
  using a recursive merge sort methodology.
- Tips:
  - Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and
    again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).
  - It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you don’t quite
    understand what should be going on.
